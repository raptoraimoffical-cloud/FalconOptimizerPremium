This reduces frametime spikes and keeps latency consistent. Graphics (highest ROI)\n- Motion blur / depth of field / film grain: **Off**.\n- Shadows: **Low/Off** (shadows are one of the most expensive settings).\n- Effects/particles/post‑processing: reduce first when fights cause drops.\n- Textures: keep within VRAM (too high → hitching).
