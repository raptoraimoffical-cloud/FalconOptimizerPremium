      "description": "[Focus: FPS] Shows a reference of useful Fortnite launch arguments and what they do, so you can copy/paste only what you actually need. Common performance-focused arguments:\n- -USEALLAVAILABLECORES → Lets Fortnite use all logical CPU cores (usually default now, but can help on some systems).\n- -NOSPLASH → Skips the splash screen for slightly faster start.\n- -noforcemaccel → Tries to disable mouse acceleration in some setups.\n- -noasynccompute → Disables async compute; sometimes smoother on problematic GPUs.\n- -d3d11 → Forces DirectX 11.\n- -d3d12 → Forces DirectX 12 (can give higher FPS but may stutter on some rigs).\n- -vulkan → Forces Vulkan (only if officially supported in your build).\n- -limitclientticks → May reduce micro-stutter on some systems by capping client ticks.\n- -refresh=X → Ask the game to run at X Hz (e.g. -refresh=240). Monitor + driver must support it.\n- -FrameRateLimit=XXX → Set custom FPS cap (e.g. -FrameRateLimit=237.000000). Stability & troubleshooting arguments:\n- -nothreading → Force single-threaded mode (rarely useful, only for specific crashes).\n- -log → Enable extra logging for debugging issues.\n- -dx11 → Same as -d3d11 (legacy alias on some builds). Notes:\n- Epic updates the engine often; some older flags may be ignored in new builds.\n- Always test arguments one-by-one or in small groups instead of spamming everything at once.\n- If FPS or stability gets worse, remove the last argument(s) you added.\n- Never trust random TikTok lists of launch options that claim +300 FPS; many are placebo or outdated.",
